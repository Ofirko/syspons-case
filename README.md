## syspons case

Case study for a software developer role at syspons. 
The code attempts to write a log for every outgoing email sent.

As this is my first time using both Laravel and PHPUnit, I've:
* Built it as an application instead of a package in an attempt to simplify the setup.
* My course of action was TDD using PHPUnit, as can be seen by the commit history.
* I've had issues with the mail server, and haven't managed to achieve a final log. All the parts are there but some connection is missing (writing logs, testing, listening to outgoing email, etc.)
